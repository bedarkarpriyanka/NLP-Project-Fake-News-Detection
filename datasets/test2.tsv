Our ruling    There is clearly much for voters to consider on the referendum to increase by a half-cent the county's sales tax rate, and the contentiousness related to the Shelby County's reorganization of public schools has created some confusion for voters.

To get numbers that approximate this, the pie chart cherry-picks just discretionary spending. But that means the pie chart represents only about one-third of federal spending.

Spending on food and agriculture is still small, but it does quadruple from 1 percent to 4 percent. Due to its skewed methodology, the pie chart offers a deeply distorted picture of federal spending.

Obama's not far off, but its actually closer to 16 percent less. And using Reagan to make a case to raise the minimum wage should be taken with a grain of salt since the former president never increased it during his two terms. And by Reagans last State of the Union, the minimum wage was $2 less than when he first took office, if you factor in inflation. We had written that Obama had said ""the federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan"" gave his first State of the Union address. As the reader pointed out, a new president's first address to a joint session of Congress -- the 1981 speech that Obama was referring to -- is not officially called a State of the Union address. So we have rewritten our paraphrase in the ruling statement above to remove the reference to the State of the Union."

However, many of those same Baathists later turned against al-Qaida in Iraq. They shifted back into the orbit of what became ISIS due to the repressive policies under Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki. The causal link is too distant to say Cheney created ISIS. His decisions contributed to the groups formation, but not more than that.

During the process, Costantino shielded his idea from the type of full political scrutiny that might have killed it. He did this by not naming 38 Studios on the House floor when he was asked who was pushing for the loan-guarantee program. When the deal was done, the CEO of Schilling's company thanked all members of the General Assembly and singled out five elected officials by name, including the former House Finance Committee chairman.

The underlying comparison is flawed. While the age of each co-op is subject to debate, we used the Census Bureaus definition to determine when they were born. Interviews with experts, government audits, and regulators actions point to three years as the typical lifespan of a failed co-op. About 50 percent of the co-ops shut down. Compared to the three-year failure rate in America, the co-ops have done much worse -- cratering at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than average. But Emanuel could turn out to be right. We wont know the five-year rate for the entire group until late in 2016 or early 2017. If the remaining co-ops are still running, then the groups failure rate will be close to the national average. Emanuels statement is accurate regarding the five-year-average but leaves out important details.

Clinton earned $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street bank, so Toomey would have had to have earned an average of about $43,000 per year on Wall Street. Its possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So its likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomeys non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars. And Toomey didnt just say it was ""possible"" he made less in six years on Wall Street than Clinton did in one speech. He said it was ""likely.

It uses some deceptive editing, and it ignores the fact that Romney was pretty consistent in both of the comments to frame his support for an assault-weapons ban in the context of a compromise that also expanded other types of gun rights. The difficulty of analyzing this charge is that Romney's position on an assault-weapons ban in the 2008 debate was so muddled that it's hard to pin down whether he actually flip-flopped. It's more an example of an internal inconsistency than a flip-flop per se. In fact, the DNC might have made a more convincing argument simply by quoting the confilcting parts of Romneys 2008 debate comment. So the DNC made some procedural missteps, but it's on to something about Romney's delicate dance on gun control.

Kaine had little control over the growth, which was largely the result of increases in federal grants, college tuition and fees charged by state hospitals. Overall spending did increase under Kaine; whether it ""soared"" is a matter of opinion. The total budget under Kaine increased at half the average rate of the six governors who preceded him. Did spending growth cause the shortfalls?All of the budget growth occurred in the non-general fund and were largely the result of actions by the federal government and state universities. All of the shortfalls occurred in the general fund that depends on a separate set of revenues to pay for public education, public safety and health programs. Lower-than-expected receipts from Virginias sales and income taxes blew holes in the general fund -- a blight that afflicted all but a few states at the end of the recession.

First, theres little debate that the meeting occurred, as it has been widely reported and not challenged by the NFL. Thats for the most part correct as well, though experts we spoke to questioned whether its the right parallel to draw. Questioning victims separately from suspects in domestic violence cases does appear to be a widespread practice both encouraged by domestic violence advocates and many police and state policies after an incident occurs. But Goodell was not conducting a criminal investigation -- that already had occurred, and he had access to that information. Also, there are occasions when couples involved in domestic violence cases are interviewed together later, allowing police and prosecutors to judge how they act with one another so they can assess credibility and potential prosecution, one expert told us.

Although there is some indication that registration and community notification may deter first-time adult offenders, the studies find that the deterrence doesnt extend to juveniles -- and that community notification likely increases repeat sex crimes and other crimes.

Kogan, a former senior adviser to the Office of Management and Budget, said its a semantic question as to whether the July, 1987 should be considered its own increase, but added he personally would consider it a second debt ceiling hike. Our ruling:    Webb said Reagan signed off 18 times on increasing the national debt. Figures from the Office of Management and Budget do show 18 laws were signed to increase the debt limit during Reagans eight years in office. A semantic argument can be made that the actual debt limit was raised only 17 times during the Reagan administration, but we dont think its worth the haggle.

""The state DCA points to Christies property tax cap as reining in taxes during his tenure, without mentioning the impact of tax relief programs that have been reduced greatly in the past few years. But reduced or eliminated tax rebates means taxpayers generally have to pony up more money to pay their tax burdens. But a number of organizations have pointed to previous DCA figures showing a net property tax increase of nearly 20 percent. An Associated Press report said the actual increase for the first three years of Christies gubernatorial tenure has been 13 percent, considering a variety of factors -- including estimates, rather than final numbers, for 2012. Given the disparity between NJ Spotlights and the APs figures, and factoring in past Truth-O-Meter fact-checks on this topic, its clear the increase isnt as high as 20 percent, but it doesnt appear to be as low as 13 percent.

Those tallies reflect what a working group was told in May 2012, but the presentation by a Capital Metro official (using a CAMPO modeling system) projected 26 additional lanes on I-35 as well as MoPac; Covingtons column did not mention the second highway and also flipped the predicted number of northbound and southbound lanes. Perhaps more significantly, these lane counts were rooted in the assumption that both highways would have unlimited capacity, presumably including space enough to be widened dramatically despite the existence of major facilities along I-35 and hundreds of homes near both highways.

Government data show decreases in January for the price of health insurance and health services. However, those measures can bounce around and if Schultz had looked a few months further back, he would have seen even steeper declines, followed by later increases. Plus, a drop in a price index doesnt always translate into a lower price for the customer. Most analysts judge health care costs not by prices but overall spending. By that measure, costs continue to rise, albeit slowly. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on containing the cost of health care remains largely unproven. Schultz had some accurate numbers on prices but he was too quick to treat those as changes in costs and the role of the Affordable Care Act is sketchy for the time being.

Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, the Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in three years: 1998,2004 and 2006. So Boehner is correct that the House has always passed a budget resolution, even though on three occasions, it later failed to work out differences with the Senate and pass a final, identical version, and once the Senate, under Democratic control,had no budget resolution.

Instead, Mack cast procedural votes that effectively allowed automatic pay raises to stand in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The practical effect of those votes meant Mack saw raises. On the flip side, LeMieux omitted that in 2009 and 2010 Mack took some votes against pay raises.

""While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said hes opposed to it. UPDATE, Feb.  22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a ""safety valve"" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. ""You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. ""He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms. ""To Pizer, these carbon limits dont fit the definition of cap and trade. ""Maybe youd call it the same family, but its different because youre telling each source, heres what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs. This idea of trying to limit businesses exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade. ""We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romneys administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations ""fit the broad definition of cap and trade. ""But he added, ""its in the eye of the beholder. ""We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters. The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact."

Factor in a reduction in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and Romneys tax rate would have fallen dramatically, almost surely reaching below 1 percent, according to media reports and tax analyses.

However, the estimate we found from the source cited by UN Women is a bit less than Watson said -- 15. 1 rather than 15. 5 million by 2030. The annual number masks two underlying trends. First, in some developing countries, the age of marriage is rising even if it remains below the threshold age of 18. Second and more important, the incidence of child marriage is falling. It just isnt falling as quickly as the population of young girls is increasing. Watsonseverely undercounts the sheer number of young marriages that will take place between now and 2030.

Further, experts cautioned us not to draw a straight line between votes and gun legislation and support for the Second Amendment.

Even though he sometimes voted against bills to expand access to guns, it is fair for Kander to say he supported the Second Amendment as a legislator.

But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate. But they leave the impression that the measures failure will lead to deep school cuts much sooner. And thats not the case.

""To his credit, Obama clarified that Republicans didnt specify those cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than the president assumed. Budget experts tell us that applying cuts evenly in the absence of other information is fair, assuming hes clear about what hes doing. But Obama's figure was based on the assumption that savings would be achieved by, among other things, reducing the maximum grant level in 2013 and beyond. The problem is, House Republicans say that their report expresses a preference to maintain a maximum award of $5,550. But that preference isnt in the budget resolution passed by the House. The president's statement is accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignore a preference that House Republicans say was reflected in the report accompanying the Ryan budget  that Pell grant maximums not be reduced beyond 2013. And, if other means were used to reduce spending on Pell Grants, such as lowering income eligibility, the impact could be different."
